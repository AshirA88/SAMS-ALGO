server as a scheduled job and with this database create a web-based UI which
helps to generate reports, send emails for giving reminders for reduced
attendance.
### Project Objectives
- To determine which fingerprint algorithm will be providing the highest accuracy and optimum result for our problem.
- To gather dataset for testing the fingerprint recognition algorithm
- To look into database security issues
